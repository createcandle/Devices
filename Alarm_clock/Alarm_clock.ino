/*
 * 
 * GENTLE ALARM CLOCK
 * 
 * This is a smart alarm clock: 
 * - It takes into account your sleep cycle and tries to wake you up at an opportune moment in that cycle.
 *   It does this in the 30 minutes before the alarm time you set. So if you set 8AM, it will find the best moment in the 7:30AM till 8AM window.
 * - Additionally, it has wake-up light functinality to slowly wake you up. If that doesn't do it, it will sound an audio alarm.
 * - Wake-up light intensity is mirrored to the controller, so that you could set the brightness of other lights in your room to be controller by the alarm clock.
 * 
 * Hardware:
 * - Arduino Nano
 * - Arduino Nano wireless expansion board
 * - NRF24 radio (to connect to MySensors controller)
 * - OLED screen
 * - Rotary encoder knob (KY-040)
 * - Motion sensor (radar type works well, but you can also use PIR)
 * - Bright LED. It should support setting varying brightness levels.
 * - Buzzer (could also trigger an MP3 player, or a voice recorder - have fun!)
 * 
 * 
 * How it works:
 * - It gets the clock time from the controller.
 * - You can set the alarm time (and enable or disable the alarm) with the rotary knob.
 * 
 * - Each minute it detects and sends the total seconds of movement during the previous minute.
 *   You can use a motion sensor of your choice for this. Point it at your sleepingplace in the bed.
 *

#define MY_REPEATER_FEATURE                         // Act as signal repeater. Should this sensor act as a repeater for your other devices? This can help the signal spread further.

#define RF_NANO                                     // RF-Nano. Check this box if you are using the RF-Nano Arduino, which has a built in radio. The Candle project uses the RF-Nano.


 /* END OF SETTINGS

 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * TO-DO
 * - Decide on a measurement value to send to the controller. "custom" would make sense, but may not be as widely supported by controllers.
 * - Toggle the alarm on-off status from the controller. This allows the workday logic to move to the controller.
 * - Turn off the screen (or show less data on it) during the night. Lower screen brightness somehow.
 * - Fix bug where audio alarm can stay on despite rotating the knob to turn it off.
 * - Check if internal clock is somewhat accurate.
 * - Make rotating knob work better. Maybe use a library..
 * - Add snooze?
 * - allow alarm to be triggered from outside the device. Useful in case of fire.
 * - MP3 player pin that stays high during the ringing phase.
 * 
 * NICE-TO-HAVE
 * - Calculate the work days (mon-fri) on-device, and offer a toggle to only sound the alarm on those days.
 * - Maybe add another separate button for enabling/disabling the alarm.
 * - make the minute loop counter work by adding up 60 loops of a second. But might make the clock very imprecise.
 * - Sensitivity dial in controller
 * - Set alarm time on the controller
